# Steam's Silence

Over the Christmas period the Steam gaming platform had a bit of an issue.


You may have been one of the many people troubled by it.


Essentially the Steam platform had a cache problem with their database that:

1. Meant when you logged in you didn't see your profile/billing info
2. Randomly got someone else's details
3. Every time you refreshed your profile you got a different person's profile - a bit like Chat Roulette, without the dick pics
