# The Morality of Adblockers

Recently the question of whether it is "moral" or right to use adblockers has come to the foreground.

Part of the focus is a consequence of Apple enabling iOS 9 to create powerful "content blockers".

A technical explanation can be read on the [Surfin' Safari blog intro to content blockers](https://www.webkit.org/blog/3476/content-blockers-first-look/) blog, but essentially Apple has made it easier than ever before for users, and developers, to create apps that block specific content.

Content that can be blocked ranges from specific websites (You can block certain Newspapers and links to their articles if you wish), tracking Cookies to Popups, Images etc.Content

The motivation for the development of these powerful blocking actions are said to be:

> "We have been building these features with a focus on providing better control over privacy. We wanted to enable better privacy filters, and that is what has been driving the feature set that exists today.
>
> There is a whole universe of features that can take advantage of the content blocker API, around privacy or better user experience. We would love to hear your feedback about what works well, what needs improvement, and what is missing."

The two driving forces articulated by Benjamin Poulain are:

1. Increased control over privacy for developers and by extension, users
2. Better user experience (through a possibly more tailored experience of no ads, no images or no content from certain websites or about certain subjects)
